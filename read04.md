# HTML
* ##### *HTML* Strinds for: Hyper Text Markup Language.
* ##### it is not WYSIWYG because you mark the tags to do something else.
* ##### There are tags called semantic tags which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on, and those tags are:
  * Strong, main, article, header, footer and nav. 
* ##### The connection of internet is starting from the web browser which is already connected to the ISP then it get directed to DNS which is giving an IP address for the web server that is hosting the website i am looking for.
* ##### When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too.
