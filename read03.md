GIT

## Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged:

1. **Committed** : changes is saved in database

2. **Modified:** the changes didnt saved in the databse which is related with gituhub.

3. **Staged:** flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.


#### There are some comands for GIT we can use to save changes, move from directory to antother directory, to upload the files on the device to he [Github](https://github.com) and we can link a message of the reson of the changes tat we have made on our project.

###### **Here some of these commands**
* `$ cd test`: it is chnging the directory poiter to another directory called test.
* `$ git clone URL`: it is copting all versions of all files for a project to device.
* ` $ git commit -m "any message here" `: This comand is used for attaching a messagr showing why the programmer made this change.
