# CSS summerization:
* CH11 summerization:
  * The color property is the responsibole for changing the foreground color.
  * In CSS, color can be specified in three ways:
    * rgb values: controling the values of red, geen, and blue and it written like this `rgb(100,100,90)`
    * hex codes: the six-digit codes and it is written like this: `#ee3e80`
    * color names:  predefined color names that are recognized by browsers and it is written like: Darkgray.
  * By default, most browserwindows have a whitebackground, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use thebackground-color property on the `<body>` element.
  * Saturation: Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.
  * Brightness: o how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.
  * When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough ***contrast*** for the text to be legible.
  * RGBA: is a color system like RGB but here we cancontrol the opacity of color.
  * HSLA: cosists of three copmonents:
    * HUE: the color it self
    * saturation: how much grey is clear in that color.
    * brightness: How black and white in that color.
    * Alpha: opacity of color.
