# Comparison:
* *in each condition usually there is one operator and two operands.*
* *The operands are the elements in the both sides of the comparison*
  * like in this example `x<y` , y and x are oprands.
* * The operator is the operation between the two operands.*
  * Like in the previous EX, `<` is the operand.
* *The result of comparison is either `True` or `False`.*
